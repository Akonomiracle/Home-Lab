# Home Lab

## Introduction

A cybersecurity home lab is a controlled environment used to simulate real-world network and security scenarios, allowing for hands-on practice in a safe setting. VirtualBox, an open-source software, enables users to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single host machine, with each VM operating as a separate computer. This setup facilitates safe experimentation with security tools, malware analysis, and network configurations without impacting the host system.

## Objective

The primary objective of this home lab is to create a secure environment for testing cybersecurity concepts and performing activities like malware analysis, threat hunting, and vulnerability assessments. Once configured, the lab can also be used to study network traffic, evaluate security tools, and refine cybersecurity skills through real-world simulations.

### Skills Learned

- Virtualization Management
    - Installing and configuring VirtualBox and managing multiple virtual machines (VMs) independently.
    - Familiarity with different virtualization settings and understanding their impact on VM performance and security.

- Network Configuration
    - Setting up various network modes (NAT, Bridge, Internal Network, Host-Only) in VirtualBox to control connectivity and isolate environments as needed.
    - Practical knowledge of network isolation, essential for malware analysis and secure testing.

- IP Addressing and Network Troubleshooting
    - Assigning static IP addresses to VMs and verifying connectivity using tools like ipconfig and ifconfig.
    - Basic troubleshooting skills to resolve connectivity issues between virtual machines, an important skill for network diagnostics.

- Security Awareness and Isolation Techniques
    - Implementing secure practices, such as using isolated internal networks to prevent potential malware from impacting the host.
    - Understanding how to safely analyze suspicious software in a contained environment, minimizing risk.

### Tools Used

- VirtualBox
- ISO Images for Operating Systems
- Network Utilities

## Steps

Step 1: Installing VirtualBox & Virtual Machines

1. Begin by downloading and installing VirtualBox on your host computer, along with virtual machine (VM) ISO image files for your desired operating systems (e.g., Windows, Kali Linux).
    - Ensure that the ISO files are compatible with VirtualBox to prevent installation issues.
2. Load the ISO images into VirtualBox to initialize the VMs.
